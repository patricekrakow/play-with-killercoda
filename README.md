# Let's Play with Killercoda

I am *BIG* fan of [Killercoda] and especially their [Ubuntu Playground](https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/ubuntu) that I am using of all sorts of exploration.

There is only one ***ANNOYING*** anti-feature being that you can only access HTTP services running on **all** interfaces (like `0.0.0.0`), which means that when you want to test an HTTP service running just on `localhost`, it does not work :-( This is very frustrating... until I find a workaround that I would like to share here ;-)
